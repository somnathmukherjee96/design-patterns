1. **Factory Design Pattern** - The Factory is a creational design pattern that simplifies object creation by using a special class(factory)
to create objects for you, so you don't have to use the `new` keyword directly. This makes it easier to change the
type of object being created without changing the code that uses it.
2. **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** - The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern provides a way to create groups of related
objects without specifying their concrete classes.
